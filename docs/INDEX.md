## üéØ How to Use These Docs

### For Implementation Work

1. **Find your stage** in the roadmap
2. **Read the stage guide** - Lists everything needed for that stage
3. **Reference generic guides** as you implement:
   - Need to write code? ‚Üí See CODE_STANDARDS.md
   - Writing tests? ‚Üí See TESTING_GUIDE.md
   - Adding error handling? ‚Üí See ERROR_HANDLING.md
   - Database operations? ‚Üí See DATABASE_OPERATIONS.md

### For Code Review

1. Check that code follows [CODE_STANDARDS.md](./CODE_STANDARDS.md)
2. Verify tests exist and follow [TESTING_GUIDE.md](./TESTING_GUIDE.md)
3. Confirm logging present per [LOGGING_GUIDE.md](./LOGGING_GUIDE.md)
4. Check error handling per [ERROR_HANDLING.md](./ERROR_HANDLING.md)

### For Debugging

1. Check [LOGGING_GUIDE.md](./LOGGING_GUIDE.md) - Adjust log levels
2. Check [ERROR_HANDLING.md](./ERROR_HANDLING.md) - Understand error types
3. Check [DATABASE_OPERATIONS.md](./DATABASE_OPERATIONS.md) - Debug queries
4. Check stage-specific guide - Stage-specific debugging tips

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Which document should I read first?**  
A: Read PROJECT_ROADMAP.md, then ARCHITECTURE.md, then your stage guide.

**Q: Where do I find logging examples?**  
A: LOGGING_GUIDE.md has complete examples organized by scenario.

**Q: How do I know what tests to write?**  
A: Your stage guide says what to test; TESTING_GUIDE.md shows how.

**Q: What if I'm stuck on something?**  
A: 1) Check your stage guide 2) Check relevant generic guide 3) Check ARCHITECTURE.md

**Q: Can I skip a stage?**  
A: No - stages have dependencies shown in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md.

**Q: How often do these docs update?**  
A: As new stages begin, their stage guide is created. Generic guides are stable.
