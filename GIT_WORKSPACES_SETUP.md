**Created:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to Use

---

## What Was Created

### 📁 Files Added to Repository

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `setup-workspaces.sh` | Automated setup script - creates all branches and worktrees |
| `GIT_WORKSPACES_GUIDE.md` | Comprehensive guide to using workspaces |
| `QUICK_START.md` | Fast 5-minute setup guide |
| `Makefile` | Convenient commands for workspace management |
| `.gitignore` | Updated to handle workspaces properly |

### 🏗️ Workspaces Created

After running `bash setup-workspaces.sh`, you'll have:

```
.worktrees/
├── dev/                          # develop branch (integration)
├── stage-1/                       # Database Foundation
├── stage-2/                       # LESS File Scanning
├── stage-3/                       # Import Hierarchy
├── stage-4/                       # CSS Rule Extraction
├── stage-5/                       # Variable Extraction
├── stage-6/                       # Tailwind Export
├── stage-7/                       # Integration & Testing
├── stage-8/                       # Chrome Extension
└── stage-9/                       # DOM Matching & Tailwind
```

Each is a complete, independent Git working directory with its own `node_modules`.

cd less-to-tailwind-parser
bash setup-workspaces.sh
```

### Step 2: Enter a Workspace

```bash
cd .worktrees/stage-1
# or
make enter-stage-1  # Using Makefile
```

### Step 3: Install & Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Start coding...
```

### Step 4: Commit & Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement feature X"
git push origin feature/01-database-foundation
```

---

## Using the Makefile

### View All Commands

```bash
make help
```

### Common Tasks

```bash
# Setup
make setup              # Create all workspaces

# Navigate
make enter-stage-1      # Enter Stage 1 (opens new shell)
make enter-stage-4      # Enter Stage 4
make enter-dev          # Enter development workspace

# Install
make install-all        # Install dependencies in all workspaces

## Typical Developer Workflow

### Day 1: Start Stage 1

```bash
# Setup (one time)
bash setup-workspaces.sh

# Enter Stage 1
cd .worktrees/stage-1

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Read what to build
cat ../../docs/stages/01_DATABASE_FOUNDATION.md

# Create first implementation
touch src/services/databaseService.ts

# Write code, run tests
npm test

# Commit when ready
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement database connection pool"
git push
```

### Day 2: Work on Different Stage

```bash
# In new terminal tab/window
cd .worktrees/stage-4  # Different stage

npm install

# ... implement Stage 4 ...

git commit -m "feat: CSS rule extraction with specificity"
git push
```

### Day 3: Parallel Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Continue Stage 1
cd .worktrees/stage-1
# ... more work ...

# Terminal 2: Continue Stage 4 (in new tab)
cd .worktrees/stage-4
# ... more work ...

# Terminal 3: Check overall progress
cd .
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

### Week 1: Create Pull Requests

```bash
# From each stage workspace
git push origin feature/XX-description

# On GitHub:
# 1. Create PR from feature/XX-description → develop
# 2. Add stage documentation reference
# 3. Request review
# 4. Merge when approved
```

## Workspace Structure

Inside each workspace (e.g., `.worktrees/stage-1/`):

```
stage-1/
├── .git/                          # Git repository
├── .stage-info.md                 # Stage reference (auto-created)
├── src/                           # Source code
│   ├── services/
│   ├── part1/
│   └── ...
├── tests/                         # Unit tests
├── docs/                          # Symlink to ../../docs
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── jest.config.js
└── node_modules/                  # Local to this workspace
```

---

## File Organization

### Documentation (shared across all workspaces)

```
docs/
├── PROJECT_ROADMAP.md             # Overall timeline
├── ARCHITECTURE.md                # System design
├── CODE_STANDARDS.md              # Coding guidelines
├── TESTING_GUIDE.md
├── ERROR_HANDLING.md
├── LOGGING_GUIDE.md
├── DATABASE_OPERATIONS.md
└── stages/
    ├── 01_DATABASE_FOUNDATION.md
    ├── 02_LESS_SCANNING.md
    ├── 03_IMPORT_HIERARCHY.md
    ├── 04_RULE_EXTRACTION.md      # CRITICAL - NEW
    ├── 05_VARIABLE_EXTRACTION.md
    ├── 06_TAILWIND_EXPORT.md

    ├── 08_CHROME_EXTENSION.md     # UPDATED
    └── 09_DOM_TO_TAILWIND.md      # UPDATED
```

### Source Code (also shared, but isolated by stage)

```
src/
├── shared/                        # Used by all stages
│   ├── database.ts
│   ├── logger.ts
│   └── types.ts

## Key Benefits of This Setup

✅ **Parallel Development**
- Work on Stage 1 and Stage 4 simultaneously
- No branch switching delays
- Each stage has independent environment

✅ **Clean Git History**
- One feature branch per stage
- Logical, reviewable commits
- Easy to track progress

✅ **Dependency Management**
- Each stage has own `node_modules`
- No conflicts between stages
- Can use different package versions if needed

✅ **Team Collaboration**
- Dev A works on Stage 1
- Dev B works on Stage 4
- Dev C works on Stage 7
- No merge conflicts

✅ **Easy Code Review**
- PR shows exactly what changed in that stage
- Reviewers see complete implementation
- Easy to test in isolation
